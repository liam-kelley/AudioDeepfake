            "105 A halo jump is a high altitude, low opening.\n",
            "106 That's what it means, that it's a jump where you're jumping from a very, very high altitude.\n",
            "107 and you open very low. So this sequence basically takes place.\n",
            "108 Over Paris, we're a very high altitude above 35,000 feet.\n",
            "109 and we're opening just above the Grand Palae. And we're doing that.\n",
            "110 so that the aircraft that we're in looks like a commercial airliner.\n",

            "116 We were like, okay, okay.\n",
            "117 Basically what McEw did is he designed the sequence.\n",
            "118 and also the sequence takes place at night.\n",
            "119 as the sun is set.\n",
            "120 So essentially we realized we have a three-minute window.\n",
            "121 upon which I jump out of the air, we do the scene inside the aircraft and jump out.\n",
            "122 And then I have to fly down and be within three feet of the lens.\n",
            "123 because he's pulling focus.\n",
            "124 which is something that's never been done before in the year because he's using film cameras having to\n",
            "125 Pull focus while he's also skydiving and I'm skydiving down to him.\n",
            "126 and I have to be within three feet of him.\n",
            "127 Three feet, not two and a half, not three and a half. It has to be three feet.\n",
            "128 because of the depth of field, because of the light.\n",
            "129 the lens that we were using.\n",
            "130 And there was just the also the thing that I needed to train in skydiving.\n",
            "131 extreme training because the sequence is incredibly\n",
            "132 grueling. It's very technical.\n",
            "133 It's very dangerous, to be honest.\n",
            "134 So with all that said, we just ended up just...\n",
            "135 pushing it to the end of the schedule is a very long schedule.\n",
            "136 Constantly from me, I'm not only acting in the movie and producing the film.\n",
            "137 I'm doing all my own stunts in there and all that all that my own action in there.\n",
            "138 from Motorcycles car skydiving helicopter and\n",
            "139 constant kind of physical training throughout the day.\n",
            "140 So we shot this at the end of the movie. I finished the film.\n",
            "141 and luckily,\n",
            "142 the United Arab Emirates.\n",
            "143 really stepped up and helped us. They said we will.\n",
            "144 We will give you our C-17.\n",
            "145 accomplish this because I, you know, we have a great relationship when I...\n",
            "146 you know, when I climbed the bridge there in Dubai and\n",
            "147 They love movies and they're in.\n",
            "148 They knew what it was we were trying to accomplish and they want to be part of it.\n",
            "149 very grateful to them.\n",
            "150 They allowed us to use our C17.\n",
            "151 So then we had to figure out how do we get the shot.\n",
            "152 And we didn't know whether we would actually be able to do it until we were there on the ground in Abu Dhabi and trained in it.\n",
            "153 and figured out how to exit out of the aircraft, you know, because the aircraft's going between the C-17s, 160.\n",
            "154 200 miles an hour.\n",
            "155 So with that level of turbulence, we had to.\n",
            "156 Find a way to exit the aircraft, even for me to be able to get close to that three feet.\n",
            "157 We broke it down to the three sections.\n",
            "158 Then we only got one take a day.\n",
            "159 So I spent the whole day training.\n",
            "160 And then...\n",
            "161 At night, we would get that one take.\n",
            "162 And it was one take. And if there is one mistake...\n",
            "163 That was it. The take was gone. And we couldn't.\n",
            "164 There's, you know, we had to do it again.\n",
            "165 So we thought we were going to be there about a week. We ended up being there. I don't know how long we were there over a month, maybe five weeks. I was there training and then.\n",
            "166 And the more times we rehearsed it,\n",
            "167 We just didn't want to be so exhausted that by the time the take came at the\n",
            "168 that night that we are physically unable to do it.\n",
            "169 And also when you're going up to altitude like that.\n",
            "170 up and down. I mean, in the C-17, they're limited to only three.\n",
            "171 hops above 18,000 feet a day.\n",
            "172 And at times we were doing way more than that. I mean, the team, not...\n",
            "173 about the C17 pilots.\n",
            "174 We were going above that training during the day and then doing it.\n",
            "175 We had to really figure out, you know?\n",
            "176 Now we can't get this done, it's a movie, you can't shoot it forever.\n",
            "177 And we have a release date.\n",
            "178 And you also don't want to be tired when you're doing it because you want all of your wits about you as you're\n",
            "179 It's not just a skydive, I'm acting as I'm doing it.\n",
            "180 There are many factors.\n",
            "181 Obviously, we talk them through very carefully, you know, when I go to do something like that.\n",
            "182 This, I'm not someone who does it.\n",
            "183 I'm very meticulous on how I prepare.\n",
            "184 physically, mentally.\n",
            "185 with everyone in the whole team and there's tons of briefings.\n",
            "186 And I really...\n",
            "187 Create a team environment and one that I push for excellence, but\n",
            "188 Obviously what we're doing is extreme and\n",
            "189 All of us know it and all of us are very respectful of that.\n",
            "190 And don't take it for granted. And it was...\n",
            "191 It's definitely challenged all of us. I mean, these skydivers that I was diving with also, they all had thousands and thousands.\n",
            "192 I didn't and\n",
            "193 It's something that we\n",
            "194 None of us took for granted.\n",
            "195 Every jump I was looking to how do I improve my skill? What do I do? You know, how can I do it better?\n",
            "196 So, all of that.\n",
            "197 You know, we had to keep in mind.\n",
            "198 Once we got that last take, that was a wrap. We finished the movie.\n",
            "199 And we don't get a chance to come back and get it again.\n",
            "200 M-Q and me, we just looked it over and called the crew together and...\n",
            "201 Show them the take and, you know.\n",
            "202 We're just all there.\n",
            "203 We all made the decision together.\n",
            "204 And you could just see, you know,\n",
            "205 When we finally said, you know, this is the take, there was just\n",
            "206 Everyone was so excited.\n",
            "207 And so proud of what.\n",
            "208 We all accomplished.\n",
            "209 I think that it's that is\n",
            "210 That is the greatest feeling.\n",
            "211 and why I think I'm addicted to movies. It is...\n",
            "212 It is something where you're working with.\n",
            "213 enormously talented people in every department.\n",
            "214 that want.\n",
            "215 to entertain that audience. They all love movies.\n",
            "216 and they're using all of their skills to try to create something for an audience.\n",

            "218 And when that moment happens, we're all...\n",
            "219 It's just amazing. It's an amazing feeling.\n",
            "220 one that you don't ever forget really.\n",
            "221 I went to Airbus.\n",
            "222 And I trained at their facility in Dallas, Texas there.\n",

            "226 The thing is when I'm flying a helicopter, I'm not just...\n",
            "227 flying the helicopter. Just the same thing when I'm driving a car or motorcycle.\n",
            "228 I'm also a lot of times when I'm there with the cameras, I'm setting a frame.\n",
            "229 There are times that I'm flying a helicopter and I'm setting a frame for Henry when I'm...\n",
            "230 behind these other helicopter plus there's\n",
            "231 an aerial helicopter.\n",
            "232 Plus I'm acting as I'm going and flying the helicopter and flying it low, flying it fast, flying it close.\n",
            "233 But obviously,\n",
            "234 There was a lot of resistance, actually, to me doing this particular stunt.\n",
            "235 Number one, it's never been done before in the way that we wanted to do it.\n",
            "236 the extreme nature of the flying.\n",
            "237 And, of course, everyone.\n",
            "238 wants to make sure that it's going to be safe.\n",
            "239 So I made sure, and one of the things that I do is I have these guys, you know, I try to surround myself with the best people.\n",
            "240 best group and have them challenge me and see how\n",
            "241 How good am I? Am I good enough to be able to do this?\n",
            "242 So a lot of stuff that I wanted to do in terms of flying low under trees.\n",
            "243 I was able to get the aircraft and do a spin.\n",
            "244 and do those spins at very low G.\n",
            "245 and low air speed and be able to pull out at a very low level.\n",
            "246 these kinds of things that\n",
            "247 that are extreme with helicopter and the things that we're doing are extreme and free.\n",
            "248 And of course,\n",
            "249 trust me and I want to be able to trust them\n",
            "250 So I did a lot of...\n",
            "251 preparation and every step of the way I made sure that\n",
            "252 that I just didn't come in going, oh, it's me, I can do this.\n",
            "253 Guys, you know, you have a right.\n",

            "261 And in doing that, it also increases my ability.\n",
            "262 And then we end up having, you know...\n",
            "263 It was the most\n",
            "264 extraordinary time in New Zealand. New Zealand is breathtakingly beautiful.\n",
            "265 and to be able to travel through New Zealand with the helicopter and the places that we're able to go.\n",

            "269 of power. Of course, you're in the mountains.\n",

            "271 of the helicopter.\n",
            "272 So it was extreme.\n",
            "273 It was like everything in mission.\n",
            "274 Every day was filled with adrenaline.\n",
            "275 I know that everyone's side.\n",

            "278 I think we're all very proud of what we accomplished.\n",
            "279 So the long line.\n",
            "280 That was intense.\n",
            "281 I have to say, I mean, my adrenaline was definitely flowing in this movie.\n",
            "282 The kind of freefall in the bag, there was an impact there at that point, and I went out.\n",
